###### Copy DirecTV receiver's HDD content to a replacement HDD ######
  - **Can only be used to transfer recordings to a _replacement_ HDD utilized on the _same_ DVR the content was recorded on**
    - _For example, to salvage recordings from a failed drive or in order to upgrade to a larger HDD_
<br></br>
  - **Cannot be utilized to copy one DVR's content to a different DVR.**  
    - _Each DVR encrypts their recorded content with a hardware encryption key unique to each receiver._
<br></br>
  - **Due to the sensitivity of eSATA, I recommend installing the HDD directly into the DirecTV box.**
    - _The firmware for the box is not stored on the HDD (HDD is solely utilized for DVR functionality)._
    - _Most boxes have release tabs which can be accessed from the bottom of the reciever (at least HR34+)._
      - _Tabs are [accessed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxgmn_L29Sc) via square-ish access holes ~2" in depth._
    - _If residing in the U.S., due to the [Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Moss_Warranty_Act), the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/04/ftc-staff-warns-companies-it-illegal-condition-warranty-coverage) has [ruled](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43724348) "Warranty Void" stickers are illegal._

###### Mounting Error ######
  - **If recieving a mounting error referencing the HDD can only be mounted** `ro` **(Read Only):**
    - _Reciever wasn't cleanly shut down_  
__OR__
    - _Reciever wasn't unplugged quick enough_
