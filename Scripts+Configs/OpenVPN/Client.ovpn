# For Windows users:
    # Use as is
    # If PKCS12 isn't withn the same directory as the ovpn, path must be referenced.

# For Android:
    # PKCS12 [line 32] is unnecessary,. as cert will be imported into the Android Keychain.

# Certificates:
    # "remote-cert-tls server" should only be utilized if generating certs using Easy-RSA.
    # "remote-cert-ku XX" should be utilized if generating certs using an openssl.cnf.
