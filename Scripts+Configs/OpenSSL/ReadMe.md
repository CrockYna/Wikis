I've included two OpenSSL.cnf configs, named OpenSSL.cnf & OpenSSL (Organized).cnf.
  - I recommend downloading OpenSSL (Organized).cnf, as I had to edit OpenSSL.cnf specifically for GitHub in order to have it appear organized and alligned.  Whether a cnf file is organized or not does not affect it's usage, however a clean, organized config file makes it much easier when reading, and/or adding to, it. 

  - OpenSSL (Organized).cnf needs to be renamed to OpenSSL.cnf once downloaded.
